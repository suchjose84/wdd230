        I believe the designer of this page grouped the page into three parts; the top, the middle, and the bottom.
        The brand name, the settings icon, and the "subscribe" text were placed on top. The top part of the
        page is the common place to put the brand name and the settings icon so it also involves consistency;
        they just added the subscribe text to fill the white space there. These three elements were grouped at
        the top but are separated which tells us that they are not really connected to each other and have
        different uses on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the middle part, we can see that the image in the center, the word "Market", and the headline were grouped
        together which tells us that
        these are related elements. Looking closely, we can see that this group is the featured article
        on the page and that it is related to the word "Market" (which surely means "stock market" because Bloomberg is
        a business-related company).
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, at the bottom, we see three lines of texts which the designer did a good job of putting dotted lines
        to separate them from the headline text above it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the designer was able to apply proximity on the page creating a nice, readable page.

      <h2>White Space Management</h2>

        This webpage from Skype is one good example of managing white spaces and creating a clean
        design out of it.
        As we look at the picture, there's really nothing much here. The owner of this website just wants us to click
        the <strong>"Create a free meeting"</strong> button in the middle (Nowadays, remote working is really getting popular
        because of the COVID19 situation around the world), the <strong>"Host A Meeting"</strong> linked 
        text which is somewhat similar, and the <strong>"Download Skype"</strong> linked text.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can only do 3 things on this webpage mainly and that is too much whitespace.
        In order to solve this, the designer added some texts and an image as an inviting factor.
        The designer added some spaces between each elements and the font sizes were bigger so the 
        page were completely covered in the end. Another thing that I like in this design is that 
        the elements were in the center of the page so some of the white spaces were pushed
        to the edges thus created a nice clean look.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, I learned a very useful technique on this page on how to manage white spaces 
        when I have very few elements to work on.

      <h2>Contrast</h2>
      <p>Ferrari</p>

      <p>
        I was trying to look for a webpage that sells high-end products to find nice pictures and came
        across Ferrari. As soon as I saw this webpage, I knew that this is a good design.

      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding contrast, the image had a darker shadow design on the top and the bottom which made
        the texts standout. The texts where white therefore stood out on the dark image. Lastly, the
        car in the middle had a lighter color. This added a visual effect of making our eyes focus on 
        the center of the image which was surely the goal of the designer.
      
      </p>
      <p>Overall, this is a good example of contrast when designing a webpage and we all should learn
        from it.
